      <description>Go gives the programmer introspection into every aspect of the language, and of a running program. But to one thing the programmer does not have access, and it is the goroutine identifier. Because the day the programmers know the goroutine identifier, they create goroutine-local storage through shared access and mutexes, and shall surely die.
In Infergo, I had to have goroutine-local storage. Here is how I got efficient goroutine-local storage in Go.</description>

      <title>Go Programs That Learn</title>

      <description>There are so many probabilistic programming languages that it is hard to choose one. Because it is so hard to choose one, a probabilistic programmer has two options:
 invent a new probabilistic programming language, or write probabilistic programs in a regular programming language.  The former choice is easier to make, that&amp;rsquo;s why there are so many different probabilistic programming languages. But writing programs is so much easier in a regular language, and programs in regular languages can do many useful things.</description>

      <description>[Poster: html, pdf]
A good part of today&amp;rsquo;s internet content is created and shaped for delivering advertisements. Internet pages are interconnected by links, and a visitor is likely to open multiple pages from the same publisher. After a while, visitors leave the web site, either due to clicking on an advertisement or just because they get bored and switch to other content or activity.
The probability distribution of the session depth — the number of pages opened during a single visit — is an important metric for the publisher.</description>

      <title>How to Hug a Data Scientist</title>

      <description>Sometimes, a data scientist is the first engineer in a software project. More often though a data scientist joins the team when there is working code, ready for deploying or even deployed. Here is how the latter case rolls out:
 We write a piece of software. Thanks to continous delivery, we fix our bugs quickly and release new improved versions on time. Our code is fully tested, easy to change, and pieces fit each other smoothly.</description>

      <title>On Brain Teasers at Job Interviews</title>

      <description>I went to a few job interviews during past weeks. Most interviewers asked me to tell about problems I had solved, and to suggest a solution to a problem they really needed to solve. Some though offered me to solve brain teasers — problems they (or others) invented to test candidates. I solved most, but I felt bad about it. I can imagine many bright candidates who would fail an interview because of brain teasers.</description>

      <description>I am a faculty member of the Computer Science department at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.
Research interests My current research is related to the field of probabilistic programming and Bayesian statistical modelling. In particular, I am interested in defining the kinds of models which can be efficiently represented and reasoned upon by means of probabilistic programming, on one hand, and in application of probabilistic programming to other areas, such as computational health, robotics, or human-computer interaction, on the other hand.</description>
