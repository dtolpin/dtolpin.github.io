  <h1>On Brain Teasers at Job Interviews</h1>
  <section>
    <p>I went to a few job interviews during past weeks. Most interviewers asked me to
tell about problems I had solved, and to suggest a solution to a problem they
really needed to solve. Some though offered me to solve brain teasers —
problems they (or others) invented to test candidates. I solved most, but I
felt bad about it. I can imagine many bright candidates who would fail an
interview because of brain teasers.</p>

<p>Brain teasers are wrong — that’s my gut feeling, but I had hard time finding an
argument to support my gut feeling. Now I have one. Here is the story of a 250
years old job interview.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yechezkel Landau, the rabbi of Prague in the second half of the 18th
century and a famous Jewish scholar, applied for the post when he was only
41. Local Jewish intellectual elite gave him a tough examination on the
jewish law. The candidate had to analyse and resolve difficult case
studies, and provide rulings for complicated situations.</p>

<p>Rabbi Yechezkel answered all questions except for one. But though he failed
to solve one particular riddle, he showed clearly that the riddle was not a
real case but a thought-up one, with the sole purpose to humiliate the
candidate.</p>

<p>Rabbi Yechezkel said that human wisdom is divine, and because it is divine
it only acts in real, God-inspired, situations. When presented with an
artificial problem, constructed by one human just to test another human,
the wisest thought is no better than a random guess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brain teasers are bad for job interviews. They are no better than choosing a
candidate by throwing a coin.</p>

<p>Rabbi Yechezkel got the job, by the way.</p>
