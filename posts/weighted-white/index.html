    <p>Gaussian processes are great for time series forecasting. The
time series does not have to be regular &mdash; &lsquo;missing data&rsquo; is
not an issue.  A kernel can be chosen to express trend,
seasonality, various degrees of smoothness, non-stationarity.
External predictors can be added as input dimensions. A prior
can be chosen to provide a reasonable forecast when little
or even no data is available.</p>
<p>However, behind the Gaussian process stands an assumption
that all observations come from a Gaussian distribution with
constant noise and the mean lying on a smooth function of time.
If the distribution of observations is multimodal or if
observations at some times are noiser than at others, the
Gaussian process does not provide an accurate forecast. For a
stock Gaussian process, observations from alternating modes or
with high noise are <em>outliers</em>, that is, data points which only
make the forecast worse rather than improve it.</p>
<hr>
<p>One such case is forecasting of <em>visit value</em> in revenue
attribution for online content. Visit value is the revenue
a single visitor brings to the content provider. A noisy
measurement of visit value is obtained by dividing the revenue
by the number of visits over a fixed time interval, for example,
over an hour. Then, based on these measurements, a forecast of
the visit value is computed. The forecast is the mean and the
standard error of the average visit value at a future time.</p>
<p><img src="/images/weighted-white/gp-forecast.png" alt="Visit value forecasting with Gaussian process"><br>
<strong>Figure 1. Visit value forecasting with Gaussian process</strong></p>
<p>If the forecast is consistent, approximately 67% of future
observations fall within the standard error of the mean. In
Figure 1 almost all of observations are within the standard
error range, which suggests that the standard error is
overestimated. Still, some of the observations which fall outside
the standard error range are due to unusual spikes in
the observed visit value, either during the preceding hour or
on the same hour a day before (the model accounts for daily
seasonality). Apparently, some noisy observations negatively
affect the quality of forecasting. If we could filter them out
or diminish their influence on the overall trend, we would be
able to improve forecasting accuracy.</p>
<p>The problem of outliers and varying noise in Gaussian processes
is not new, and solutions were proposed in the past. One of the
solutions is <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~andrewgw/tprocess.pdf">Student's <em>t</em>-processes</a>,
which are similar to Gaussian processes but are based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-distribution">Student's
<em>t</em>-distribution</a>
instead of the Gaussian distribution. The Student's
<em>t</em>-distribution has a similar bell-like shape but heavier tails,
resulting in unusually deviating measurements having lower
influence on the forecast.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Student_t_pdf.svg/650px-Student_t_pdf.svg.png" alt="Student-t distribution"><br>
<strong>Figure 2. Student-t distribution with different degrees of
normality ν (from Wikipedia)</strong></p>
<p>Theoretically, this is a promising solution. There is also an
<a href="https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/GP-TProcess.html">implementation of Student's <em>t</em>-processes in
Python</a>.
Practically though, Student's <em>t</em>-processes are not as flexible
in supporting elaborated kernels accounting for different
seasonalities, external predictors, or non-stationarity.
Gaussian processes are also much more widely adopted and better
tested and supported. We would definitely prefer to use Gaussian
processes if we could find a way to accommodate for varying noise.</p>
<p>While in general that would be too much to ask for, in the case
of visit value forecasting we know the relative noise of
different observations, which is  proportional to the number
of visits over which the average visit value is estimated:
the variance of a visit value estimate over an hour with 10
visits will be ten times higher than over an hour with 100
visits.  As usually done with Gaussian processes, we estimate
the noise factor by maximizing the likelihood of observations,
but for each observation we divide the factor by the number of
visits. For forecasting, we multiply the observation noise by
the average number of visits per observation.</p>
<p>We implemented this &lsquo;weighted noise&rsquo; trick for the
<a href="scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a> version of Gaussian processes,
using the
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels.WhiteKernel.html">WhiteKernel</a>
as the starting point and modifying the code to accept
observation weights. Figure 3 compares forecasting with fixed
(orange) and weighted (green) noise. The weighted noise
prediction gives much tighter confidence bounds, while still
closely following the dynamics of the average visit value.</p>
<p><img src="/images/weighted-white/weighted-gp-forecast.png" alt="Visit value forecasting with weighted noise"><br>
<strong>Figure 3. Visit value forecasting with Gaussian process and weighted noise</strong></p>
<p>This addition took only a couple dozen lines of code, including
tests, and greatly improved forecasting accuracy. In this case,
a simple solution taking into account the structure of data and
the process of data collection gave excellent results at a low
development and deployment cost.</p>
