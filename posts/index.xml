      <description>A good part of today&amp;rsquo;s internet content is created and shaped for delivering advertisements. Internet articles are split into pages stitched by forward links, so that the visitor reads the article in multiple steps in a fixed order, and advertisements can be shown on every page. In a lucky case for the publisher, the visitor clicks through the full article, eventually reaching the last page. Most visitors though leave in the middle of an article, either due to clicking on an advertising or just because they get bored and switch to other content or activity.</description>

      <title>On Brain Teasers at Job Interviews</title>

      <description>I went to a few job interviews during past weeks. Most interviewers asked me to tell about problems I had solved, and to suggest a solution to a problem they really needed to solve. Some though offered me to solve brain teasers — problems they (or others) invented to test candidates. I solved most, but I felt bad about it. I can imagine many bright candidates who would fail an interview because of brain teasers.</description>
